# Price Prediction Using Financial News Sentiment

This repository contains the Week 1 challenge of the 10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery Program. The objective is to explore how financial news headlines influence stock price movements using natural language processing (NLP) and technical indicators.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict short-term stock price movements by analyzing the sentiment of financial news headlines and linking it with quantitative technical indicators. The work is designed to simulate a real-world data analyst or machine learning engineer's workflow in the financial domain.

We aim to:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on financial news data
- Compute technical indicators from historical stock market data
- Investigate the correlation between sentiment scores and daily stock returns
- Provide meaningful insights that could support investment decisions
